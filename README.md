# Djangfolio
Welcome to Djangfolio! A portfolio template website created in Django. I created this tool to host my own portfolio website. The current version of this project includes:

- A nice header with profile picture and short description of the current function of the user.
- An about me section with optional links to social media platforms and GitHub.
- A timeline including the current career of the user.
- A nice projects page including the project the user has done with respective image and link.
- A contact page where someone is able to contact the user.

All of these sections are optional and automatically hidden if no model objects/settings are present to display the corresponding section.

## Setup
To use the code in this repository, you should follow a deploying Django application tutorial such as the one specified [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Deployment).
